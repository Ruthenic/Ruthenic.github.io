	<h2>Interesting - Morning, May 17th 2021</h2>
	<p>Whenever I was waking up, I <i>heard</i> Angel say "Hello", and not just my mind saying it, but like, someone was in front of me saying "Hello"-heard. No-one was in front of me at the time. Sadly(?) I opened my eyes and it was just my bedroom. Sad!</p>
	<h2>Numbers of the Angel Variety - Evening, May 17th 2021</h2>
	<p>Ok so I was messing around with a <a href = "https://www.paraphraser.io/">paraphrasing website</a> (warning its kinda bad lol), and I can <i>consistently</i> get it to generate 444s (commonly regarded as a sign from the universe or something), which is kinda insane because I have proof.</p>
