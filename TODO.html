    <ol>
        <li>ADD A COMMENT SYSTEM YOU FUCKING IDIOT YOU ALREADY MADE THIS WHY DID YOU REMOVE IT INSTEAD OF PUSH IT</li>
        <li>Write more blog posts. A couple of ideas:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>More psuedo-intellectual content about my (uninformed, probably terrible) philosophical takes.</li>
            <li>Subliminal pt2 (although, that would require taking time out of my "busy" schedule (which now includes school) to listen to subliminal content, so this may take a while to happen)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Remove rambles section (as it currently is, the section is entirely useless for writing on topics, as it would be far more effective (at least to me) to write a blog post, and instead take notes while studying/participating in the topics discussed (can just be a simple txt or markdown, as opposed to editing HTML as I do for the site currently), and include those notes in an addendum or footnotes section.)</li>    
    </ol> <!--- What are the chances that none of these will happen? :p --->
