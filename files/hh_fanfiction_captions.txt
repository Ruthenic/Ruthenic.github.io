because it's it's actually cut out from
an
hour-long recording session that i did
that will be released later
is the variety is the is a ver
is a variety as a variety episode
basically
just a bunch of them but this i figured
was good enough it had all the qualities
of
fan fiction that we like on here so i
figured
that we could just do it use it
so so i cut it out and this is what
we're gonna see
so thanks bye
and i can't remember what i was about to
say uh
i remember this one now i can't remember
it was this one or another one
but one of these was really concerning
but you know what since this is the
variety episode
we don't have a reason not to am i right
this is gonna be the
variety episode yeah it's settled at
your bio why in
the spider species spider demon know

no i'm kind of mean though then how then
then htf that ended up in hell
noting that abbreviation uh
how did the hell end in well hell cool
the opposite of me uh sounds exactly
like me it's either
not me or me also you can't
can't just write a character that's
totally ambiguous as to what their
personality
is you can't do that you might not know
what their personality is until you
start getting into the group of writing
but they're gonna have a personality of
some kind even if even if it massively
oh yeah oh god how do you want to meet
angel dust
and the pro and husband hotel prologue
he sees you when you're leaning back
against the wall
or something else perhaps yes
meeting him
once again relatively sure that's just
the credits not even bothering at this
point though
oh boy it's pilot time gamers
it's been two weeks since you arrived in
hell and yet you were struggling you had
no money no house no nothing
you tried to ask her out but no one was
going to help you out so you decided you
were better off alone
as you were as you walking down on the
street
oh yeah this is going to be good you
sighed
sigh well i guess it couldn't get much
worse
uh i wonder where this is going you said
that just as you said that you heard a
car coming why did i just say that
you jumped in the way and quickly hidden
in that way when you did you watched
something or someone exit the vehicle
what how there's not some things what
you
yes
as you look at the white female out of
context
that sounds bad and blushed the way she
looked
wow she looks so beautiful
you said you continue to watch yes
thanks for the fun time hot stuff yeah
listen keep this discreet hear me
i can't let it get i don't know from my
services durando's on the street it was
a quick cash grab
you got it he asked whatever he is
like
oh oh such an insult
let me know when you come up with
something great if you call me a
stack-up holy package holy [ __ ]
tell the missus i said i comes angel
said
you watched as the car left leaving him
behind
he i don't know how we know it's a he
already
you watched as a car left right here
behind he didn't turn around you thought
he was looking at you so you quickly hit
ah this is the alleyway they're talking
about i see
well let me just uh yeah this is the
variety episode no one cares about what
i'm doing so
uh let's just do a little bit of photo
editing
copy image paste here here we go here's
what here's how it looks so
let's see so let's just uh blow up our
image a little bit there we go
let's grab our black let's just grab our
uh
i know i think it needs to be white
instead just where it's invisible
against the background
uh all right all right all right all
right all right
uh let's just grab the line yup uh
simply fantastic drawing i must say i
definitely belong on the on the spindle
horse
team after this one uh let's see just
it's perfect it's perfect this is
exactly what the author intended
all right give me a second i'm actually
just going to post this on discord real
quick
all right we're back i i mean i just had
to have a rest after that
even ignoring me posting on discord
sadly
uh see i bet the comments are gonna be
worth oc
don't do drugs kids do angel instead
do not take my advice
literally just that quote
oh you braced him to come at you but you
didn't he watched it
you watched it he pulled out a bag of
drugs but but suddenly take it from him
hey you and him stu said at the same
time he then looked around you said that
and you quickly had
up yours drag show they said but then a
rock
came out of the out of nowhere and
crushed the thief even though
leaving leave it leaving the white male
shocked
oh my god my drags damn it he said as he
gasps
actually didn't actually need a spit
after that
by the way no no it is not
it's not blood yet
once again literally just ranged from
he then looked up and you looked up to
see a blimp shooting at buildings there
you know but he did he looked around
once and saw you watching
hey yo he said he snapped out of fault
and gasps because he's all coming to you
you quickly hit him clinched in fear how
do you clench in fear
what's the matter why are you hiding he
you didn't say anything
come on there's no sense in hiding i
just saw you come on i ain't gonna hurt
you or anything
you didn't want to believe it but the
way he said sounded promising
you slowly emerge from your hiding spot
that's it come on he said
now how do i know you won't reject me
like everyone else you
yeah just wait wait wait
no no no that's our character that's why
uh that's it come on
he said how do i know that you won't
reject me like everyone else you just
asked
just trust me he said you walked runs
the light and you stared out
sir no one what how did you crawl out of
you asked i'm yin but if i had any
friends they'd call me
cute name he said making you blush
why did you say that we're both males
you're a male
right you said that you asked don't tell
anyone this but i'm actually a male in
disguise as a female
big bunk named anthony but i'm better
known as angelus pleased to meet you
angel said as he extended his hand out
you too you said did you grab his hand
he pulled you to him
i don't know where you came from but i
okay okay okay i gotta pause to regain
my health and not check discord totally
not check discord
all right all right we're back we're
all right i'd say the same to you but
i'm afraid it would send me the wrong
message what
everyone gets the wrong message in hell
so no worries uh
well anyway what are we gonna do with
the blind
you asked oh i have an old friend over
there that's having
fun might as well tagging you're welcome
to tag along if you want
angel said i don't know you said
don't tell me you haven't done anything
like this because i promise if you
didn't
i can teach you how we do things here
now come on i think i'll be
fine angel said
define your way of fun you said
that's a good question uh in many ways
you don't know
angel said it's all about it inside all
right
i'll try excellent but first we gotta
get you in the character
really as he discreetly hu dug your
hands into a shirt into your shirt
oh really you asked angel smart and you
felt your fur chest
fur chest pushed up
uh he you flinched in after your minutes
he dug his hands out
man you didn't tell me that your phone
was super soft
angel said oh god what was that voice i
turned in there to a minute
you opened your eyes and looked down to
realize what angel did
and flushed no one's here i've been
going on
oh we hit an hour and i missed it damn
well that's cool uh i'm probably gonna
cut this last one out now i think about
it
and so i can do this for a separate
series because this is
better than i remember uh it's
it's got enough of those uh weird
grammar mistakes to be funny
it's got enough plot quality to be
interesting
and it's a fan fiction so it'll be bad
as well i'm not saying all fanfictions
are bad most of them are though
anyways you opened your eyes and looked
down
to realize what angel did and blushed
you know blush on
you can't blush on a man and even if i
did you wouldn't know
angel are you crazy i look like i have
breath now people think i'm a girl
now you said blushing and you look at me
i'm pressed up chest for a real
real revealing what looks like what
looks like you have rest
that's the fun part besides you're a
spider like me trust me
you stick with me and i'll teach you the
basics to the advanced you're the
working hell
oh and by the way along the way it gets
sexual
angel says he walked he blushed again
what does he mean by that you asked
don't you know what do you mean
or did you ask that yourself in your
head
so anyways you get my
you get my bad grammar clap that because
that's what me when i wake up me drugs
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah
okay are we gonna continue reading i'm
not reading this next part
i'm honestly saving this for next time
let's just uh pop it into
choose i think i have another like no i
don't have that in this computer so
we're just gonna save it with the
videos uh
ff to finish or f or fftf
we're just gonna save it there and let's
see what oh i don't know you can do tags
that's cool
uh fan fiction videos to read
there we go perfect uh
all right okay i might call this here
honestly
because i still gotta edit this part out
which i am gonna edit this part out i've
so it's probably gonna end up being less
than an hour sadly
and i'm also gonna have to end up
recording a separate outro
so yeah uh
goodbye for now i get oh yeah let me
just actually put this in there
uh blah fftf
</endoftext>

<startoftext>
just the constant grind gamers
i'm actually sick now so i'm probably
not going to be objecting to this
as much as normal but as you can see
i've said
[ __ ] wattpad and we're going to the two
other main sources of fanfiction online
ao3 and fanfiction.net
uh i i have already found one that is
using
literal important tags good
slash bad start depending on what you
think
oh god so
let's see why do we have uh i've already
been through the first page
nothing interesting here it
the why is there so many of those
how do you have 19 of those i'm not even
oh god let's see
nothing that interesting all of this is
kind of boring
i say i'm sick but then i laugh like
that
oh yeah all right i'm just going to read
all these
uh graphic depictions of violence
christopher million says
the crystalline campers mentioned
also i like this tag this tag usually
means
my story is [ __ ] up
yes that's what it means totally
see nothing interesting nothing that
looks like it's terribly written
this is also are they just cross posting
now
i'm terrible at ideas so let's see how
okay to start off
number one makes no sense
because imps are hellborn so why would
that that that will end up just being
smart from whoever writes it
and
that one just doesn't make any sense
okay i gotta read these ideas
what oh god i don't mean castro sees
although that literally just seems like
you replaced a few names
and changed a few things doesn't really
change anything
oh god okay okay this one's this one's
definitely gotta go
cut throat good and or terrible pun
depending on how you look at it
i have no way to tie this outside of ao3
so chapters won't be unfinished i do not
use trigger warnings take that to tumblr
as mental is not for children so neither
will this pick be oh and
brown is not dead yeah i don't yeah that
would that would uh
nope not one to usually say too soon but
if he had died and you wrote this
that would be too soon
i suck at certain lesser character
personalities so if you butcher the two
characters who have literally not been
seen in the show yet
i'm sorry alton bears contest
oh god oh god oh my god
alton bears contest bear
bear what
oh god i read ahead i need to stop doing
that without reading
a loud whale pierced through the sky and
with it came a dark form that fell
through the red clouds are ended with a
hard thus on the ground
yes the thus on the ground the figure
sat up and rubbed their head
a tuft of brown care covered his head in
the rest of his body
he stood up and turned around and
around scared of his surroundings
he could have given out a warning before
dropping me he brushed himself
fixing his chef uniform another thing
was no longer white but black blue
borders buttons he patted his head once
more oh where is it did i drop
did i drop that's always what i do when
you encounter one of those
you you act like the characters you got
just got fiber wired
uh seeing what he was looking for he
picked it up a chef's hat which he fit
it over his head and covered the fuzzy
brown bare ears
also alton bay that makes me hate that
once you fixed up you walk down the
street and looking consciously okay you
put me in hell in the car
what no now i'm just confused
i'm talking about i'm right here
alton behind my card rolled up and
stopped them in the lord within the car
was a well-dressed man with porcelain
skin
loose not so loud yes get in
the man the door open and the man split
over to allow alton
in once in and safe the driver drove off
lucifer
offered a drink in which alton took
there we go got my caffeine fix get it
because it's probably alcohol and that
caffeine is a drug
good to see you you'll be a wonderful
addition to the mayhem around here the
residents are getting rather bored
sure i'm not stuck here right wait
between the obvious liquor event
so you you somehow got in contact with
you you somehow
did is there just a magic portal that
loose for waved a hand of course not
hell has no
room for someone so well hell has no
room for someone so
well no hell has no room and you weren't
put here you'll be returned to heaven by
the end of the week
oh he's out of heaven oh
alt inside with relief engulfed down the
rest of his drink
outside the window they were parked at
what seemed to be a news station
the building all the cargo looked like
what either looked like
red skin or thick red what
and either red red wed
red skin or thick webs alton wasn't sure
which
was clearly labeled news station 666
a large radio tower loomed overhead
broadcasting whatever new event was
taking place in his business
lucer led him into the building and up
to the back room to prepare you mustn't
give him much other than script
which he threw in the trash he watched
the two newscasters and prepared for his
q
will we see him forecast a blood of
mayhem in the northwest hemisphere
followed by the guts of enemies later
this evening
anything to add tom up next we have a
special guest straight from heaven
not god but alan brown
alias my the gamer alan brown
alton yeah yeah
you were there slash us uh rolled his
eyes and stepped it to his
spot on stage when he did he was greeted
with stifled rafter and giggles from the
audience
well i'm sorry we did did we get sent
the wrong person
you look like a child's teddy bear katie
left
she was right his ears were not well
covered with champagne
and despite the fact that he finds her
claws his fluffy fur and less than scary
features compared to the rest of the
humans
demons he dare he was there he say it
cute hi i'm
alton brown he ignored what
he corrected while ignoring the laughter
i speak host of cut throat
no space also to t can you spell that
actually
assuming it's like a cut
through a rope cut throat right
alton he should be out to cut road
kitchen then i died
and i'm here to answer new contests
given by your um
leader in quotation marks apparently
themes in the studio went silently spoke
about the contest through university one
free woods granted by lucifer with no
strings attached asked a risk
apart from the one string that is so
just as the camera's about paying back
to a stun katie alton made one less
comment
per request from lucifer this will be a
cooking contest like unlike any other i
won't allow just anyone to join you must
have experience beyond your demon powers
yes i am very sure that will happen
[Music]
once cameron's back down to katie owen
left with snap demons in the audience
chatting amongst themselves
the show was about to begin
asterisk asterisk asterisk extra attack
i just had to take a little pause there
within the hotel members of the
residents have been watching the news
with every bit of information charlie's
smile grow
bigger i'm floating my slime along
maggie said behind her wasn't skewed
with her blocking the tv a little
charlie's movements told her she was
i don't know how your movements reveal
once alton walked off stage and
presumably cut the commercial
charlie began jumping excitedly i'm not
jumping i'm not doing sound effects
today
oh my gosh maggie do you know what this
means oh you can get more publicity for
the
hotel that you've already ruined on the
exact same television network
you're going to enter the contest and
have your dad wish to tell to be a
success
exactly it's going to be great well
are you sure you're not exempt i mean he
is your dad
no yeah yeah that actually makes sense
because you know
very biased as we say but i mean it's
not like
what's his name it's not like lucifer is
gonna be
judging the contest probably trademark
charlie soldiers slumped
and she let go of magazine folder only
across the stretch short and thought i
can try right of course so we'll take
your tips for applying
vegas such as right our friends to the
kitchen in the kitchen
if you i'm gonna oh god i can't read any
more of this
i'm gonna start making these tts videos
and the kitchen nifty was scuttering
about after cleaning up
after very busy eldester who was busy
making some kind culinary concoction
my favorite the scent of cooking meat
and vegetables lingered and landed on
charlie's nose it almost picked her up
and carried her through the oven
i'm just going to say this i'm quite a
big fan of cup kitchen it is far better
than chopped
a doughnut me wow wow that smells
delicious hey well hey thank you my dear
he shooed vague to move away from
another subsequent sauce that was
simmering
did you see the news too yes i just did
it i'm happy to announce that i'm
applying for the contest
alistair said maggie scout
a radio demon wondering what's up too
alistair you need to be cheerful and
reassure the girls
don't worry i'm hoping to win to help
this place we didn't make a deal after
all
you didn't actually but okay as soon as
smile shred across his face and while
vaga wasn't impressed with rincey would
help charlie getting the benefit out
once more
this is going to be great she's up with
a bounce in herself with both of us
entering we have a better chance of
winning
i'm not even this has
why would you know i'm not going to say
anything
about lucifer not wanting alistar to win
we don't know the canon
unless it's in a podcast somewhere i'm
i'm
i'm going to make a reference to how
annoying that is
going back to cooking pouring the sauce
over the cooked vegetables and flipping
them over the paint now inspired
charlotte graduated from being their own
recipe
further downtown the porn studio was
oddly silent
valentino was in his office coming
through local newspaper and eyeing the
front page cover about the cooking
contest
this day had been on the the day he had
been on his arms loose for popping into
the news of his own and it weighed on
oh no you did include it i can't
why why didn't you include include alton
brown
should have included them in the
character smh where's the cutthroat
kitchen fandom at where my cut worth
kitchen fandom homies at
oh god no i gotta come up with fake
voices oh boy
what do you mean our deal is off
valentino sneering stunk
stroke strut strut struggle to keep
composure
valentino sat in the chair or lucifer
sat on the chair
from vala's death because he unfolded
neatly in despite the groin was not
happy about telling him
valid news population in hell has
exceeded expectations
in other words the bars to keep more
powerful demons from being safe from
execution
is moved you should be grateful i'm even
warning you
lucifer said frankly the color drained
from valentino's face and he
unable to really do anything he was no
match for lucifer he huffed and took a
drag
is that the term from a cigarette
letting the sensation calm before taking
his mess move
is that all he asked was for not in
point and valentino pointed to the door
i'm pointing my door
get out then this took a bow and excused
himself
a plum of smoke that slams the door shut
behind him
or are we not in the third are we not
out of the first chapter yet it's
we're starting to get to the 20 minute
mark dang
now looking at the front page a plan was
hatching in his head the
only problem was he couldn't cook he
balled up the paper
do i have any paper i can ball up in
fact i do he he
he bought on the paper and threw it
across the room
he was swearing under his breath
valentino racked his brain maybe someone
could go in his place
names of his girls ran across his head
who could he get to do it
who could cook and then it dawned on him
a certain spider even dressed in a maid
outfit that actually made food for a
customer
okay he should be in his dressing room
right now
he got up and left within the halls of
the porn studio there were the dressing
rooms marked with the names of barry
stars one was right with me here in the
diamonds list of red letters that's why
the spider-man was fixing the bow tie
and checking for imperfections his hair
went over the door he nearly
jumped out of his shorts oh of course i
said i'm not going to jump then i jump
and they spun around quickly did you see
valentino why so
jumpy my angel
angel collected himself and nothing i
thought i thought everyone left already
what do you want
boss i have a new job for you
i'll tie this studio that got angel's
attention
as val explained you're taken to this
he handed the paper to angel okay now
that's not the best idea in mind when he
saw about the wish he looked up at val
what what's the catch get it
no no that doesn't what you're to wish
for my immunity from
execution angel was confused his head
cut to the side
wow i know i said someone is some action
inside up outside of porn but
but this brow grabbed his face and
suddenly stared the spider demon down
did i say you had a choice
no but but but but
his clothes were digging into his cheeks
an angel could feel pinpricks of blood
for the splats
you're going to join you're going to win
and if you lose
i'll see it to you that you're the first
executed this year
angel flinched he wasn't afraid of being
killed in hell but being executed
another story he gulped in now the best
he good while i'm valentino's ripped he
val said happily and then he turned to
left once again angel picked up the
now i can't grab that thing i was using
the paper
his fate was sealed it's actually it's
actually a snack wrapper
fun fact oh we're almost done at the end
of the first chapter
back of the hallway cherry broken of
course
that i don't also why asterisk this
whatever i'm back in the hallway cherry
broken courtesy of the key angel gabriel
and was on her way to walt angel back to
the hotel before she turned the corner
she saw valentin angel's room and
stopped short appearing into the room
carefully the whole scene went down and
she fought the urge to stuff a bomb
underneath mark demon's throat here i
will mock up this
okay there we go i just that fun fact my
this is left in him he ducked back down
the hall and waited for him to leave
for morphing into a natural last voice
angel jumped once again
why does everyone feel like staring the
[ __ ] out of me today he ruffled his hair
and turned to see terry
the emotion of my voice
i was in the area and thought i'd take
you out for a drink cherry alfred
they began to leave an angel shook his
head now i gotta do something at the
hotel
you mean that contest you heard about
okay of course i did the old horn has
another thing coming if you think you
can find you like that
angel crosses on to look down at the
walk rock rock
i guess they look down the walk as they
eroded
well yeah i don't have a choice a cherry
brought a few little bombs from
like so he stuffed some of these babies
up his ass and only shook his head once
again angel powdered and threw the bombs
off in the distance
they exploded behind him sitting around
to be flying through the air and almost
landing almost then from them
they stepped to the bottom of the
heaping half warden without telling
cherry building sport of armor and a
friend all the way before they enter the
attacks
hey david i used fingerprint casserole
where you getting that
chair put both hands on the shoulder i
mean why don't i enter with you i can
cook better than half of these sinners
here
i'm glad that i'm looking into winning
to get you out of val's [ __ ] hands
for once
oh thanks probably what the chance that
will even make that top five
jerry shrugged and they answered their
hotel made their way to the kitchen to
practicing of their entry
i thought they said they had they never
know how to cook
uh there are seven more of these i think
i'm good for now
it's not as bad as some of the others i
read i think it's things better than
has motel x male depressed reader
but uh once again
the link loud one is still somehow
topping it i don't know how i don't know
why
it just is oh all right goodbye i guess

candidate i can never say candidate uh

professor it would have felt
nicely on the couch as soon as i got
home but no

a little a
a humongous spider just lying on the
floor i get all the place

i mentally screamed mainly because if i
actually screamed i would be chewed out
by my neighbor
i quickly grabbed the yes this thing
close to me or the guesses
i quickly grabbed the guess
as he missed 2018 i quickly grabbed the
closest thing to me which happened to me
an old suit
shoe that was inside the door but guess
what the little [ __ ]
climbed inside the shoe instead of dying
i quickly sprinted to the balcony
and threw the shoe as far as i could now
normally i would throw
a shoe onto my into my wall but uh it's
uh 202 am i'm not doing that i'm sorry
folks
uh now you may be asking yourself
why the hell are you so afraid of
spiders
well their voice in my head slash the
person
reading this let me tell you
hey what is it amy
look at this cute little spider i found
while i'm clasping your hand for you
definitely going to get bit uh someone's
going to give it
she said while unsk unclasping her hand
for you to see
you looked so small but stilled her out
i
[ __ ] feel like no i didn't break my
neck i would be calling
uh she called my next hurt whatever you
looked and saw a small but
still terrifying spider chilling on her
palm
frick you yelled as he backed away from
me
what is it he won't hurt you
spiders are cool two seconds later
gets bitten she
you put her hand closer to you so gee
the spider was no harm
sadly that was not a very smart choice
the spider
that's little [ __ ] decided to jump on
your face while
his hands were uncovered you being a
normal person did the only logical thing
which was to
scream
yes sorry i had to do that you raped for
that one sorry
uh it attracted the attention of the
other students and you caught a glimpse
of a short cold pink hair company i'm
totally gonna write a poem about this
you felt your hair being gently braided
you were confused you quieted down
however you looked and saw
amy braiding your hair to calm you down
the hell oh yes
oh yes messing with my hair with no
consent
what a fantastic idea
have you ever taken any more from this
girl and without thinking you hardly
pushed her away
you'd only just realize what you've done
after you stormed up in the opposite
direction of amy you're not aiming for
the rest of the year and when you're
exposing that performer again
that doesn't have anything to do with
spiders that had something to do with
the [ __ ]
what the [ __ ] amy
i'm still trying to never try to contact
amy since i've started cult so you can't
been in contact with her before
i guess deep down i'm still pissed at
her for the spider incident i worsened
my fear and i get stupid whenever i see
the two legged
spooders uh did you do that to rhyme you
rhyme at the end of or not at the
beginning
after a few stretch stretch
stretch stretch
i'm trying to murder us better i finally
plugged down on the other uncomfortable
couch and ended up falling asleep
wait why is there a part two to this i
mean i get
introducing this kid our argument
but one angel is there's no contagion
behind wanting to uh
get tossed into the real world
oh finally got er angel's pov
finally i fell off the rest of my day i
for the god that tim can't do anything
for himself
angel thought to himself as he finally
made it back to the hotel he
thought he could go to his room without
any more options but of course not
hi angel oh no i i've officially decided
on an australian tar
mail at charlie because uh
it's the only spare voice i have
that i can do it at the middle of nine
without preparation
oh yeah angel how was your day mate
charlie asked the pink
the pink mail it was going fine until
you decide to open your goddamn mouth
you're right and hissed charlie sign
okay okay my i know you i know you're
tired but you could please
try to act a little bit rehabilitated i
finally convinced you
my dad to check out the hotel and he
could get seriously offended without
your type of
humor and air quotes charlie pleaded
if i say yes will you leave me alone
angel ass clearly annoyed
charlie nodded vigorously i'm not gonna
throw my headphones off once again two
o'clock at night
then final can i will consider helping
he said he suddenly got away on top of a
charlie buried him in a hug
off me and that oh thank you angel i
promise you i regret it
drugs are well smiling oh no no that's
enough today
and now that now that's it that's enough
kiddo kiddo
kiddo kiddo interested to her is he only
she only sent for the hug he continues
to walk up to the stairs towards his
room
i don't know i don't know any
[ __ ] no i don't know anybody
nothing he thought himself he didn't
have to make anyone happy
and oh my [ __ ] god there was a
[ __ ] spider in my room
when i was in the middle of writing this
and he was one of those
last ones he disappeared now i don't
know where he is probably not in my
mouth in the morning
no i don't i know you don't care that
i'm gonna turn that into a cop faster oh
my [ __ ] god there was this
while i was in the middle of writing
this name was one of those speedy and
tallest ones
he disappeared now i don't know where he
is
when ian woke up from her sunblock he
checked her
annoying [ __ ] you won't leave me to
[ __ ] alone

and uh the things ensue trademark
copyright i don't actually know the
trademarking copyright to those i wish i

angel's pov i was kind of laying in my
bed
and heard footsteps stopping me stopping
at my door and then the sound of tuned
knocking angel my father's here you know
you want to introduce yourself
all right i hear the word relational
voice
oh she's really counting on me huh big
mistake
like drowned and finally got up for my
bed stress and stretching
as i made my way to the door i sighed
with my luck nugs
as i gave the big hat i opened the door
and slowly locked out contemplating
decisions i previously made such as
am i really gonna do this am i really
gonna walk into the hotel lobby
am i really gonna is he really gonna pay
me for this
told myself yeah this is the right
decision can't
show any weaknesses at all says
my voice cracks i thought as i made my
way to the interest of the hotel
as i made my way there i showed i saw
charlie showing lucifer around the
kitchen
obviously trying to stall for time
imagine stalling for time just send them
head on
just burst into the room yeah the master
key
just slam that puppy open
hey dad let me introduce you to one of
our almost fully rehabilitated patients
all right dad this
is angel dust the the pawn star the
the the one you just looked on and saw
the next videos the other night
yeah yeah i saw you i got i got i got
team viewer installed on your phone i
dead this is angel dust the devil gave
me another interest look time to start
this riot
and by riot you mean get thrown through
a portal to the human world
i i'm still 99 sure that's how this is
gonna end
uh i grabbed his hand and started
shaking it
it's a [ __ ] pleasure to meet yellow c
i said with no
shame whatsoever this time he didn't
know
he didn't know that he had [ __ ] up
he gave me a confused and disgusted look
wondering why a cotton like me was
touching his majesty's hand
in my eyes say you look hella hot today
gets kicked out immediately i glanced at
charlie
for a moment sierra worried stares
pleading for me to stop
slavicha i can't show weakness
and by weakness you mean
i mean the the yeah i don't know where
i'm going with that one
yeah charlie's talk oh god what am i
going to do for
lucero's face and uh charlie
charlie's told me so much yeah
you know
oh all right i to me i had to read ahead
and by now the devil's face was pink
from
pinker than normal from embarrassment
anger perhaps you know how about you and
and your life pretend to like chocolate
dream was nothing but a carpet stain
our mother won't even give her the time
of the day or where is she nowadays you
in fact by a little visit i said
and that was it that is when he knew
he had [ __ ] up
he gave me an infuriating glare angel
dust was it
he said well i'm going to work well
charlotte
i think i've seen enough here angel of
since you're so confident around your
mouth in such an insulting way
oh thank you the love of punishment
uh right right now that no doubt i
promise he's getting better
enough enough enough charlotte
wait i just need more time i said enough
trial and human contact
he stated wait what i have
oh [ __ ] oh how are we doing on the timer
so we got nine minutes left all right
uh why wait what i have to live with
those lazy ass
[ __ ] you shall
live amongst the humans for one month
that should be enough time to learn your
lesson
i'm betting that the conclusion to this
is gonna be the angel won't stay in the
human world
for a longer time you know
i i i just have a feeling
i turned around i was looking starts you
was looking but i was easy to hurt
across the features
you shall go now
why i don't get to pack a few things
without another word
snap snap i cannot stand my fingers for
the life of me
uh and transport angels to the land of
[ __ ] loud charlie was still trying to
process that's not meanwhile that's
after that meanwhile is something that
is simultaneously happening
you mean later not not meanwhile
uh when nifty came in through i swear
it's not two f's but it's definitely too
off that i've checked multiple times
wait wait where's angel she asked this
was really fun to make
tell me if you'd like this story or not
oh by the way do people actually read
this
well apparently uh people do read them
as evidenced by the fact that i am
reading them
oh my loud i want to laugh so hard but
i can't because mothers ex what the [ __ ]
oh
mobile communication
well i heard angel does this probably to
prevent shipping of any sort
if anything it's more than likely uh
and by more than likely i mean oh no
unexpected visitor unexpected visitor
unexpected
minister the real question is what the
hell is that picture
all right weird uh that should be good
all right we're back
in all right yinz p.o.b you check the
time
[ __ ] at 7 45 p.m i better start getting
ready for this
party you thought to yourself party in
quotes
i'm just going to be 10 to 20 young
adults drinking too obnoxious music
and getting way too excited to drink in
the woods
in other words a party i was gonna say
you started by going into your room
you've had
to find the best outfit you had hey you
might not care about these people all
but there was no way in hell you were
going to go out
in a poor college student outfit
consisting of poor college student
clothes
you made your way to the closet which
had a small amount of clothes in it
because
poor college student as you looked
around the closet
you found the most decent thing in your
closet
uh so those so the one you use when you
go to your
porn job i good this one's definitely
going to get the min
the the men uh run running up to you
and okay but i do really like this
outfit
they try best to make your bathroom
without falling flattering use normal
shoes you don't have to use heels why
they gotta make high heels so high b
they gotta be high
otherwise they'll lose their reputation
a reputation of being high
all right as you're doing your routine
you saw your thoughts done make you feel
bad sprinkled with general ones of
course i don't have any sprinkling
i wonder what happened to amy who puts a
goddamn
spider in someone's face i wanted to
have food at the party
you pause to break up a moment now well
nah we're all broke probably just going
to be cheap food that tastes like cactus
or something
you you chuckled out loud
causing you to mess up your eyeliner
yeah
you cursed because eyeliner is really
hard to do and at least
you open the cabinets grab the makeup
remover what if amy's really messed up
because of me
you reach for a cotton round no no
no none of those copper rounds none of
those uh
not gonna say it i'm not gonna say my
joke i'm not gonna say it
you reach for cotton round no that
doesn't seem right she probably doesn't
even remember me
you wiped your eyelid with the damn con
round and started again
you decided that your eye looked decent
enough you always put on a thin layer of
lip loss to finish this whole thing you
had going is this half the chapter
what are we still on prologue too now
we're on unexpected visitor
also very convenient that it's someone
the angel does is land gonna gonna land
in
that uh you walked out of your bathroom
and hold filled your own pen bag
think what the essentials phone house
keys
pepper spray
yeah he had no chill when it came to
being paranoid was that was that was
that a russian
bush pepper spray potentially old man
you walk towards the door this is you
were out to turn the handle
you felt a feeling in your stomach like
something wasn't right
what is this before you could decide for
the feeling your question was answered
you heard aloud coming from your room
you stood
you stood stunned before slowly inching
toward your room
your part was hound your heart was
pounding through your ears
you tried to tell yourself it was
nothing but you knew that that couldn't
you reached into your handbag pulling
out your knife just in case
tightly clasping the knife in one hand
you made it to the door
no your shaky hand started to turn the
be right back sorry i gotta interrupt
this is my monologue i'll be right back
i gotta check i
was i even i don't even know all right
answer discord
i'm back hopefully for real your shaky
hand started to turn the handle
very slowly you open the door door open
right you could see your shadow strewn
about the room
sorry if anyone just got jumped scared
by that
all right you open the door
door open wide you could see your shadow
strewn about the room
you look around your knife at the ready
you decide i need to laugh the horror
movies for a bit
you thought to yourself just as i took
your quads to close the door you thought
you saw the slightest
amount of movement out of the corner of
your eye and just like that
you were terrified again this seems like
something
very easy to make is a short film can i
buy the film fights
you hear your head snapped to the corner
you screamed in your head there was no
way in hell you were gonna turn on the
light since you ever broke into your
what's that so you don't want to know
who turned up
who whoever broke into your room so
i mean obviously our character wouldn't
know this is angel just yet
so do they just not want to know who it
is do they not want to report them to
the police
all right all right you you you all
sure called a dumb hole or movie
decision but i'd rather die
unknowingly than facing michael or their
you whispered into the darkness you
remembered something crucial
you had all your extra weapons why the
[ __ ] do you have so many
weapons you you have a pocket knife
pepper spray and a vague extra weapons
is this america if you have extra
weapons just
in the corner of your room you're
definitely an american
duh i gotta do you gotta i gotta
uh uh mi6 uh whatever the no that's no
that's the british spy agency
not a gun whatever uh you tried to
adjust your eyes to the darkness but it
wasn't working because the hallway right
light is too bright
you so the hallway part is too bright to
adjust i'm not even
anymore i mean if you wanted to get the
basic idea of who you were typed with
nope you weren't going to do that you
were going to do something
much much worse without thinking you
took
a step towards the person and then
another
you then reached out your hand to turn
on the light
you looked back at the person only to
find a
thing not a person a thing
it had white fur with pinkie accident so
it might be about eight
foot tall which is very tall
uh that's also probably just holds my
so uh good height good
good to know i have a scale now uh
for one of what looked to be about four
eight feet tall
four arms from the look of it bright
pink eyes one of us having a back
black sclera sclera
sc lira a pink and white stripe
laser with a bow tie i'm being gloves in
the back when you start looking looking
thing
looking looking really high black roots
oh boy comments
we're going to get there yep
wait is that the author yes
all right all right i've had my
i've had my break time to get back to
i think it looked like a prostitute but
then you realized what this
abomination i would like to have a world
was
uh that that that voice clip is public
domain
and it's free to use uh all right i
can't believe it
that [ __ ] really had the audacity it
was means through summary
being portal and to think i was offering
yeah no i i i can't do any comedy at
night i can't yell i can't do
my sound effects so your rape it is
we're going back to the good old days
in my good old days i mean boy
the portal felt like a drunk straw
blight party and
not the good kind
uh funny because our main character
isn't going to a party
that will probably have strobe lights on
it's all these vibrant ass colors even
more vibrant than i'm used to
feel like i was falling through that
thing for hours my eyes were starting to
hurt
suddenly i felt started suddenly what
i feel myself fall on an extremely hard
surface with a loud bump
what the hell i muttered into the dim
you found a sticky note on my chest i
pulled it off and sang
i looked around another room i was in it
seemed to be a bedroom
the bed was on me there were papers and
clothes screwing about the room
books out of place closet wide open
inside the closet they were
female looking clothes human female
yes i know i'm in the right place
i was about to investigate it further
when they heard the door
suddenly open i don't have a door with
imagine the door she had a long sleeve
turtleneck thing on with a mini skirt
and some boots
well i wonder what she was all dolled up
for i would say he has
good style but that will be alive
where's the saturation
don't use boring nude colors if you're
going out i noticed
she had something in her hand it seemed
to be a pocket knife
[ __ ] yes i made more noise than i
thought you literally said you landed
with a loud thump
i think yes
i guess you didn't see me because she
started to close the door again i did
not need to give myself a more trouble
from now on i'm staying on the download
throwing it back where i belong to this
age while
i started shimmying to the closet
because that would be a better hiding
spot but i guess i moved too soon
because she stopped him in the movement
she whispered that can't be good i
thought
that i could tell that many things were
racing through her mind at the moment
because she did something unexpected
she walked in and turned the light on
completely destroying my hiding tactics
my voice morphed into like five
different ones during that
not rereading it i had a lot of fun with
this chapter and i'm oddly proud of it
uh let's see the true questions uh
uh all right boring arian what the hell
flying through your head as you scared
as you stared at the being in front of
i have to be dreaming it's gonna be real
spider you whispered out loud
the arachnid arachnid blinked
hey hannah you're [ __ ] about getting
higher ceilings
the being asked you stood there
there uh t-h-e-i-r
that's not how you spell there
there
and not even a second later i ran out of
the room screaming
this is what i give a murdering goddamn
spider i shouldn't live in my house no i
know the price you have to pay for
killing lower ride force
higher ones come you scream as you lane
to the living room to eat your phones
angels blvd she found me
what the hell do i do now run
she frantically thought of what to do
spider she whispered i'm usually
terrified
uh hey hon i ever thought about getting
a higher ceilings
he sputtered next thing he knew there
was running out of the room screaming
talking about getting a
spider god damn trying to kill me
angel's thought is he started to run
after really
this would make for a good parody this
will make for a good horror movie parody
all right i'm back i i just keep taking
breaks
uh oh we're 33 minutes long i might
do one full session and read the entire
and split into videos and upload them on
schedule dates
uh we in the pov i need a mad dash for
the living room but i just get to my
phone
i probably won't die dangling from how i
see the spider thing
is chasing after me [ __ ]
the world seems to slow down as i'm
running i can hear my heart beating
through my ears
the adrenaline taking over my body into
life felt numb i finally made it to the
so you can bet that i went livid was my
uh trying to rap i'm guessing trying to
rapidly unlocked it
and continuously using the wrong
fingerprint every time
as i grabbed the device i felt something
grabs my shoulder it was one of spidey's
i shoved away and took a picture of it i
just got you on camera sucker i taunted
he gave me a he it gave me an are you
sure about that
face what a [ __ ] as i started to move
away from the iraq then i tripped on my
stupid high heel
he opened up high heels high heel and
fell to the ground
yeah i'm on before i could do any more
of the sliding thing and
kneeled it down and put one of his nasty
spidy hands over my mouth
could you just shut up and let me
explain for a sec
uh it was said in a new york accent it
looked female judgment
that just judging by the color scheme
but from the sound of his voice it
sounded more male than anything
i get the slide i did slightly david
just maybe
the thing that appeared in your room
whoa no no no no no no
we stop the story when you see that
what the hell in which the reader takes
care of the characters that are somehow
turned into a child toddler
how the hell is anyone like this uh
toddler okay what's the difference
between
yeah i don't even know if i want to know
uh please don't tell me this is
actually still updated i think okay
all right whatever
uh distraction i'm related i got the
slight idea that just maybe this thing
didn't want to kill me
so out of sight fear and morbid
curiosity i nodded
i promise presumably he asked
i nodded again okay i'm gonna trust you
on this he said before slowly moving
for my face no matter how much wanted to
i didn't okay my name is angel dust
i'm an even from hell stop right there
actually the story doesn't and i got
sent to the living room for a month
because i heard the devil's pretty
little
feelings angel said still salty i said
they're dumbfounded
the devil fell angel dust the drug hell
human wait wait majority men and hell is
real
i asked him but yes yes smart ass
angel responded annoyed yes some is some
sort of
hunger dreaming you might have not
expected them to hear
what yes i am you're looking at hell's
finest poor star babe
he chirped poop pup
you asked for blessing yeah i want to
see some of my work
he said with that shitty grin no no god
god please no
the irony of god here uh is you face
turn a faint
shade of pink calm down sweetheart i
don't have any
access to me my stuff anyway uh i've
gone on with this on my blog
link in the description but the thing
transforming people to and fro the
husband hotel universe
is i'm assuming that they would still
have their phones on them and if so
do their phones work in the other worlds
version of the internet
and if they do can they access the other
or other other worlds internet the world
that they're originally from
so say in theory if you went to earth
could your health phone
still post uh to post pictures and
uh uh uh anyways
calm down sweetheart i don't have access
to any of my stuff anyway even if i
wanted to
he said while chuckling because that's
definitely what i was worried about
he muttered sarcastically anyways he got
a name sweet cheeks
yes using that stupid nickname which uh
needs to be underlined for some reason
like you can do bold but nah
let's do the under why not bold
underlined why not
uh italics underlined
underlined above a centered bolded
uh uh sprays yeah there we go uh
wait why are we going yun the hell
why are we calling angel by our own
names
i've gotten tagged on this so i don't
have anything else to say
let's see ian is your name real angel
dusty
you said curiously yes sweetheart yeah
sure to ask a lot of questions don't you
well you are a weird spider demon thing
and you are in my house
so what do you expect i start you said
starting to get very annoyed by the side
of the same spider
oh snot key i like it
anyway sweetheart i got a big favor to
ask of you
he said while dusting off his hooker
they are cold shirts i don't know if
you've heard of them
they come in many shapes and sizes small
large extra large ex extra small
kids kids extra small kids extra large
kids
you raised an eyebrow with them can i
live with you until i have to go back to
hell come on
please he said well give me his best
no he said something
like come on even in the eyes and
everything
no you said again a smile slowly forming
on your face
please they'll kill me out here he
pleaded
his plea did make you think though if he
went outside
he would immediately get arrested for
not wrong uh but also potentially not
right uh
sexual assault or his appearance loan
no you and i get arrested you would be
raided by the fbi
and the nsa and every government known
to man
well i've used that exact line before
somehow
i've once again if i had if i had a
nickel
for every time i've had to say that line
with and has military related things
it would be twice which it's only two
nickels but it's weird that it happened
twice
all right here we go by you not
responding he thought of his next trick
he would use
i guess boring that's just gonna have to
get slaughtered by some humans
wish i could have gotten some dignity
though maybe a friend would be nice
he said as he tried to look on the verge
of tears he dramatically walked to the
door
he gave one last puppy dog stand face
before pretending to turn the handle
okay fine just just shut up
she said annoying i knew you'd come
around
with sharpie happiness time
skip
okay so time skip did we skip the
uh festival fall thing uh the play would
be to
uh bring angel there so but no one will
know because they'll just think it's the
drugs
because there are definitely drugs there
like there's no way they're not drugs
very well all i know there's angels us
in fact there probably is angel dust
there because that's the most
obvious thing okay so if you're gonna
live here
we need to set some ground rules you
said whatever you say
sweet cheeks he said while sitting on
the couch i'll get him pillow
okay first you can't go outside bless
him with you
he stayed you stated you really want to
be with me huh
shut up he's over there
hey it's late and you just got a new
annoying roommate he told him
immediately shut him up
okay second you have to uphold the law
say hell no more if you arrested subject
you're busted the fbi is knocking down
your door
wait if you got killed here would you go
to double hell
would you go back to normal hill in a
different form
angel growing will read to it nasty no
touchy touchy
all right but right now it's time to go
night to night
where do you want to sleep i actually
don't answer that you can sleep on the
couch
you made your way over to the bathroom
obnoxious first buffoon make him miss
out of party i didn't want to go to
i heard that i heard that he got in the
go to sleep you called back
you had him talking a response i made
your way to the bedroom as you laid in
bed you thought about what your life was
going to be like
this uh next month or so you probably
all right so i think we're going to
leave it here for this episode
but since i'm in the mood i'm gonna
record a second episode in the same
session perhaps even a third
so yeah alright so goodbye for this
episode you'll see
the next episode whenever i schedule it

so no you have no context go read it
yourself
unrelated six comments
oh no not that line before we get to the
reading real quick
the world is cursed humans cursed
oh people people people people people
people people people people people
i like how you're not concerned about uh
unlike how you're concerned about nifty
being an adult
okay okay okay so let's see 199 started
following him and he didn't know
school or town well once you got a
school to start walking down so it's
free so if you're gonna be here until i
graduate then where are you going to
live
so the house is not too far from here
showing nifty said nifty showing but
what
they then looked at the door to main to
the mansion to see alistar standing
there in his human form along with
another man
who upon closer inspection he realized
was husk
ah yes uncredited
what are you guys doing here avoiding
the cleansing
sad alistar walking inside the other
three followed eventually they got into
a built-in bar in the living room out
lincoln link hole in this side on the
countertop alistar sat in the chair
and husk went behind the bar when she
started running around the living room
okay i'm trying to make sure i don't
avoid any mic problems like i had last
time oh boy isn't it fun when you record
anyways before i get even more angry
about that than i already am
let's go back to reading so why you
mentioned you strike me as the first
type of person who prefer a cabin in the
woods
over a mansion oh i would but trust me
when i say abort
oh i would but trust me when i say a boy
nifty is an unhappy nifty and unhappy
nifty as i'm not enough do you want to
see
okay alice lincoln saw that husk also
shivered slightly
shivering not a seizure shivering
slightly before going back to drinking
his views
okay so what actually is more accurate
that's what it's like okay okay i get it
i get it i got sound effects
real life sound effects screw on that
synthetic [ __ ]
so you chose an emptiness so that if you
would never get bored yes
said also but there are a few rooms in
fact there are a few rooms that need to
be
cleaned said house club enough for nifty
asked if you're running around in
circles
down the hall my dear said alistair
nifty then ran off into finding the mess
to clean it
okay that happened said lincoln turning
well he still began to take well at
least she'll be entertained for a while
said huskin i think he then looked at
the time so i was in here for so i had
to start heading back home i'll see you
later so lincoln
astronaut and started playing and
started playing poker with huss because
lincoln left 30 minutes later he got
back home to see his sister's
wait why would they not question why i
just popped off for like an
hour they're not not quite an hour but
it's probably a good 10 minutes then
they've popped out before going home
so i think that's normal so
let's check out the comments right here
save the innocence of this precious
child great destroying oh god
oh god what the hell nope nope nope nope
popping up no okay we'll read that later
because um
where have you been
asked for me at a friend's house said
lord
are you sure it was a friend cause lucy
said you walked away
from the school with a woman he had
said lori lincoln then looked at lucy
said lincoln anything grabbed lincoln
and led him upstairs to his room before
before closing the door i don't have any
good i don't have a door actually so
she kneeled down to be on lincoln's
level hold on oh i don't gotta [ __ ]
would help if i i didn't accidentally
unplug my headset okay anyway
so kneeling down here please for the
lord of god and savior don't you lie to
me baby bro was that a friend of yours
ask luna seriously
yeah that was definitely a serious thing
on my my end if i can walk
let's see i dropped my mouse doing that
so uh you better be happy
i don't even know where it went of
oh i think it's down here somewhere all
thankfully the batteries are still in at
okay well that was a disaster that
oh okay okay okay so while i'm getting
this back on uh she's just a friend said
lincoln oh
yes luna i promise it was just friends
that lincoln luna nada didn't stand it
up
i don't know if i trust you hang around
this person who none of us know so i
want to meet her
oh god okay okay that was far too much
okay okay pausing for a second oh god
lincoln just nodded
there was nothing he could do at this
point
luna then uh turned around and left
lincoln leaving in his
yes left lincoln leaving in his room
i've given up at this point
lincoln then flopped on his bed and
stayed there until it was dinner time
oh god i hate doing sound effects but i
there we go i flipped on my bed
hopefully that didn't like manage to
pull out my
mouse somehow or something uh
okay lincoln does not there was nothing
to do with this point luna then turned
and left lady lincoln in his room
linking the flops on his bed and stayed
there until it was dinner time
once it was dinner time lincoln left his
room went to the kitchen to
eat where he sat down and started to eat
before he noticed that all of his family
was looking at him hold on i don't have
any i don't have any food on me
hey why you looking at me okay no uh but
what ask lincoln your sister's
apostrophe
you were someone they didn't know santa

the sex once again i do not condone this
that they come out as a minor and i do
we know you were have you we know you
were happy to have you
you know we're we're happy to have you
back your
son but could you tell us about what
happened while you were with that
man he was so happy to find out lincoln
was live but it was a little put off
when
rita described alastair to them i woke
up in a log cabin
and he offered me food before i told him
what happened and he offered me to help
get back here
i gotta get my mic out of my chair
wheels
okay okay let me get back here when is
that hoping they will leave it
that that was moving my headphones for
finishing his enter excusing himself
from the table and getting ready for bed
once i was only laying down his bed
closed his eyes only up and a few things
they don't say hey
i'm in hell he's then stop and look to
his
all right to see elsewhere in here this
is with the right for my computer screen
what's on the agenda tonight ask the
link on
we're gonna meet why gonna tell us that
because we're going to find a tv
said i'll start stopping why said
lincoln
i see uh
because the manager of the hotel will be
on soon said house through then tapped
his kid on the ground
a second a second later lincoln rose of
standing behind a bunch of
a bit and a bunch of behind a people
found himself at standing a bunch of
behind the people
what did you do i teleported us to a tv
said alistair
lincoln then looked ahead as two people
sat down and started
talking talking good afternoon i'm
katie giljoy and i'm tom trench
said tom and welcome back to the [ __ ]
news they are interesting
okay once again i must but by my
disclaimer that i do not support this
link a lot of the minor
and anyone who makes smart with a link
allowed and any other members of the
loud family are
his are disgusting thank you they're
chaos out of pentagram city today as the
tough falls are raging on the west side
between notable king ben sarpentius
and self-proclaimed spunky powerhouse
cherry bomb
that's great so we have fan art and we
have just a shot from the show casually
that's right tom after the recent
examination the many areas are now up
for grabs
demons all over hell are already duking
out to gain more new territory
those two seem to be really going at it
huh
see it looks like they're fighting both
i said katie before eating both the
tooth and nail and i'd like to nail her
hot spot
said tom chuckling but lincoln raised an
eyebrow on confusion because he didn't
know exactly what tom meant oh god
oh god oh god oh no oh no this already
burns up on my mind what's going to
happen
he then recoiled a bit in shock at what
kg is next
you are a limp dick jackass tom or
should i say
no dick i don't have a cup that's empty
and you wouldn't even hear it really
hear it anyway so
no uh say kd spilling the coffee on
tom's dick
not again said tom holding his dick in
pain
and coming up next we have an exclusive
interview with the daughter of hell's
own head honcho who's here to discuss
our brand new passion project
she then grifter talk here her cup
tightly and broke it before turning down
no one's outside also all the black
crows are gone so
uh i wonder if the black crows meant
that it was uh gonna be safe for work
and uh oh no uh actually if the
news is anything to go by that's
actually exactly what they meant
did you see the girl who was on the news
bomb
uh yeah she's also an acquaintance of
mine who you'll meet some other times
said alistar what about the other girl
said as lincoln charlotte ming
also i call it charlie she's lose for
his daughter and she's one who manages
the hotel i'm interested in so when do
we meet her
afterward don hit so alistair lincoln
then watched the tv went back to the
news station and katie kilroy rushed
back into her seat
snapping crew nick in the process and
then relocating it also
gotta agree with my man uh person
correction
nano nano net 972
so welcome back so charlotte
it's charlie said charlie was now
sitting next katie i
am constantly getting these screwed up
of course it's the one that's uploaded
by deadpool
i have never seen that banner before
that's really weird um anyways
whatever tell us about this new passion
project that you've been insistently
pettering our news station about
getting in charlie's face right here
this actually in real life that's me
banging my head on my wall
uh well as most of you know i was born
here in hell growing up i was trying to
get on everything around me how's my
homie where my people used to put in the
seminary
last week's close breaks my heart
achieved people's heart every year no
one's doing change i can't think of
anything wrong with praise i live in
being subject to search violence so i've
been thinking is there a more humane way
to handle
overpopulation here hell yes perhaps we
can really tell certain range resources
to redemption
so yes i think those projects claim to
ladies and gentlemen
from the first of its kind hotel the
rehabilitation centers you know because
telltale's for
temperature people passing temporarily
i feel like several places to places
like towards redemption yay
said charlie lincoln then turned to
alistar
alistair okay
okay
okay i'm calling so something weird just
happened there uh can i
uh might might like somewhat pulled out
okay weird uh that's not right can i
have one still play audio
weird uh i'm assuming it's still
recording
as she was on singing lincoln heard
someone calling her called color singing
[ __ ] before i ever started laughing what
in the night circles makes you think a
single digit in hell would give two
shits about becoming a better person
yeah i know for this little experiment
even worse you just won't be able to
good
just because it's like katie killjoy
well we have a patient already who
believes in our cousins
incredible progress said charlie oh and
who might that be
oh just someone named angel dust
what is porn ashley oh god
okay okay okay the mic monitoring is
back now i have no idea what's going on
you [ __ ] would tom it's like katie
turning towards tom
thompson looked away nervously in any
case
it's not even a compliment i'm sure you
can get that hook to do anything with
some booger sugar and lube
this transcript is simply fantastic
slash s
there could have been a far there's a
far better one on the wiki probably
actually you know what
let me check that real quick
ones
shockingly there isn't uh that's odd
oh look okay oh i begged enough reason
behaved clean out of trouble for two
weeks now
let's set that record back to zero
spoiler alert
okay then put our hand up to our
earpiece for smiling and pushing charlie
that's my mouse pretend it's shortly we
are receiving word that a new player has
entered the ongoing terror for
let's go to the live feed said haiti is
a little box up here in the top left
you said charlie when you saw who it was
oh [ __ ] indeed
it looks like the one who's enjoying the
battle is none of them poor nectar angel
dust
what a juicy coincidence you must feel
very stupid right now
said katie her and tom started laughing
together
writings don't look at this said tom
trying to block the little screen
well it sure looks like your little
project is dead on arrival
tell us how does it feel to be a total
failure ass jd giving
getting in uh charlie charles face
yeah well how does it feel like i got
not a pin but a pencil but you know what
it works got your pencil [ __ ]
there you go all right creature for
attackers tom ran across the screen on
fire before the broadcast ended
well that was interesting to lincoln
indeed and very entertaining you can do
italics right into italics
saliva lincoln the followed alistar down
the street so we are heading to hotel
now last lincoln
yes sad alistar lincoln nada before
memories on the
blog hey you don't really believe in
redemption do you ask we can ah
no then why are you trying to help out
with the hotel
to find out soon enough lincoln nodded
again and continued
walking in silence until they reached
the hotel
they stopped at the door remember
that foster present and everything
they'll freak them out i said also for
closing his eyes knocking on the door my
knocking on my monitor actually really
sounds like knocking on the door
actually i didn't know that
uh cool i guess maybe kind of not really
um
and then you are open charlie was
standing there as soon as he looked up
to me alistair's
eye eyes he showed them throwing his
lord going as he smiled down there
hello before
before the door was shut in a space
charlie then opened the door again wow
that outside before the door slammed
shut again they then heard
talking on this either side of lincoln
looked up on the alistar
good job but now oh now freaking them
out sailing is our castle
thank you what's that aleister charlie
the charlie then opened again revealing
may i speak now asks alistar
oh no why do i keep okay okay pause
pause pause
pleasure to be meeting you sweetheart
quite a pleasure excused by my son in
business but i saw your future on the
picture show and i just couldn't resist
what's up performance why i haven't been
that an attention to stock market crash
of 1929
so many orphans said alistair
stop stop right stomp stop right there i
know your game and i'm not gonna let you
hurt anyone you papa's cheesy talk
talks oh talks how [ __ ] lore said a grey
skinned girl pointing a spear and a last
door's faced
no i'm not
alistair just smiled down at her her
with his glowing red eyes where's
lincoln and all this uh
charlie and the grey-skinned girl behind
her just looked at him with unreadable
expression as lincoln scared
stared at him confused while walking in
and starting the door behind him
elsewhere and shook his head and eyes
turned back to normal no i'm here
because i want to
help say what now
help hello is this thing on testing
testing
said i'll start typing the microphone on
this game well i heard you loud and
clear
said the speaker opening before an eye
closing again um you want to
help with ask charlie only be cut off as
alistair disappeared
and reappeared as a shadow behind them
more for taking form
this ridiculous thing you're trying to
do this hotel would help you run it to
the ouster
but why actually ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
why does anyone do anything
sure absolute boredom
i've lacked inspiration for decades
before my emerald became
mundane lacking focus
i've come to crave a new form of
entertainment
mon montane montane yes
just getting to a festival with reporter
kennedy's entertainment astrology
kind my dear reality true
passion after all the world is a stage
and a stage is a world of entertainment
so does this thing you think it's
possible real hell is that a faded demon
asked okay oh god why did i read through
the entirety of the
this part of the pile of one act
three of the pilot i think i don't know
what you would call it no
like two the final act the allister
the my voice just back back it was at
this point
uh of course now that's whacky nonsense
redemption hoho of a non-existent
humanity
no no no i don't think that there's
anything left that could save such
loathsome
sinners the times they were given us the
life they lived before
and their punishment is this there was
no one doing what has done but
lincoln might what you can tell where
the vivzy pop writing is
and where the red 16 dragon writing is
pause pause pause to collect my breath
holy [ __ ] i'm tired oh yeah my lungs oh
okay breath collected just like my dad
isn't collected
got him it was this point that the other
finalists are noticing
finally a slight branch from the pilot
holy
hello my name is charlie how are you
okay apparently i'm not much better than
anyways uh it was this hello my name is
charlie said charlie holding out her
hand
it is supposed to be her lincoln out to
lincoln shaking her hand these two over
there are my girlfriend maggie and
friend
have you ever considered putting uh
i don't want to share the d on face
did i just [ __ ] say oh my god
oh god anyways okay okay i'm gonna
oh what [ __ ]
oh god oh yeah okay okay okay okay okay
yeah i don't want to share the d on
facebook
oh okay
well i mean i don't want to share i i
don't want to either to do
to either meanings here either meaning
the d on facebook
those two over there my girlfriend
maggie and friend angel dust
capitalize the d so charlie lincoln just
acknowledgement so are you new to hell
actually yes
just died two days quotation marks
uh apostrophe ago said like can i wait
i'm scared to know what happened it was
so hard to hear about anyone less than
at least 14 dying and anyone
younger than that down here was usually
more than
hell that's more
someone is people finally here to stop
not yet not quite yet no one's here to
stop me
good i think we can make it to the end
of uh what are we on currently uh
chapter three
yeah chapter three uh twelve charlie's
eyes widened surprised to this
it was so red here about anyone that
left them oh oh so apparently
only people 14 and above can die
today i learned wow
do you think it's possible to read all
day centers
well i don't think it's impossible but i
don't know how you would go about it
okay okay okay okay
okay i'm not i'm not reading anything
else from the pilot
it says as i'm about to read something
uh let's call lincoln's interest you
know that's what's going on
here not big on politics decades ago
looks like a strawberry pimp said angel
there oh that that that impression is
[ __ ]
uh anyway but apparently
lincoln chuckled a bit at this he didn't
understand the pin part or what it meant
but alistair did look like a strawberry
he then stopped when he knows alistar
uh pilot pilot pilot pipe pilot pilot
pilot
ply apply ply ply ply ply ply ply pilot
okay i swear to god uh just skip
think in my boy you shall be working
here when you're not up there
said alastair you cannot now should walk
to the middle where we might suppose i
can catch
your favorite nifty little darling and
it's nifty
holy [ __ ] it's done oh my god
okay that was far more effort than it
was ever worth
uh i basically just read through the
last half of the
or at this point uh maybe like uh
to it no not two thirds quite uh okay
i'm pausing for the next chapter because
alternatively i don't feel like doing
this also i didn't realize that my
why are these chapters so long holy all
time for the next chapter lincoln was
currently standing in front of the hotel
he then heard a noise
and look to the front door to see his
acquaintances coming out wearing
different uniforms the receptionist the
waiter the chef
the bartender the housekeeper the
doorman nice outfits
said lincoln thanks lincoln said nifty
now lincoln you have a very important
job i said officer
and what would that be said lincoln
you're going to help everyone
said hello alistair i have to help
everyone yes whatever y'all need it all
you don't really need to most attack
somebody being and i don't
they won't do them and i couldn't decide
for them help or kill tomorrow so you're
going to help them
feel like something like that press kill
the way you do this
things just now there's something to do
alone because they know that you know i
was really reckoning and he would
[ __ ] die
uh or he and he would right here maybe
see his family anything in there or they
could do a house or hold him
go kill somebody oh oh i know what it is
oh i know what he can do
kill his family where they're all down
break the deal with hallister
you won the game also i've been
recording an hour
of this and i'm on the fourth chapter
fifth actually
uh because apparently because chapter
zero is a thing for some reason
i know the killing is not something that
you want to do you have to realize that
you are in hell and there's someone you
understand to kill
yeah i suddenly walk into the hood and
locked a bit and found nifty and if you
do want to make it clean uh pure lincoln
come in now watch and learn
and so fastlane you can see it for
stopping from the lincoln's completely
thoughtless
nearly candy
do you mean candy in real life or candy
in the hell
god
why why why what
what what what is this
cars man uh
let's see in which alice
jeff honduras dude dude you're in here
talking about freaks instead of
answering your phone
oh i'm kind of in a war right now
destroying the government and all
oh yeah well i bought the pineapple the
yeah this is the voice i'm doing now
deal with it
anyways lots of candy deal
that's lincoln deal i'll get it get it
i'm going to be driving this thing by
sleeping
we all know the plot twist is when
clyde finds out because i've seen enough
of the lighthouse to know what the
general characters are
obviously i don't know my name but uh
let's see it was a lie
he didn't have to sleep you can tell i'm
kind of just skimming through this at
let me come kill without a reason
eventually
i'm gonna go downstairs for dinner when
his family worry about let me close his
eyes back in hell
so alistair so what's happening
hey mom needed help and killing a mob
boss and a bunch of his underlings
apparently i okay yep random voice
oh i thought oh i saw that live counter
ah you know pausing i'm pausing i'm
pausing i gotta take a break gotta take
okay uh why do i have to be able to do
it because
angel can't help but in case we actually
get some occupants in the hotel
you even need to get your first kill all
the way wait he hasn't had his first
kill
you know he's [ __ ] spent out here for
oh i need to pause for a second all
right this we're gonna have to end it
here for today
but i am definitely popping this in the
bookmarks uh just

like that's all i have to say this is so
out of character
like i can like i mean it's just
fanfiction why am i complaining about
but i can see just about any other
character doing this but you have to
pick alistar
the one that makes absolutely no sense
for this
i mean i didn't have this complaint
about well
i hate the fact that i'm saying this
once more i didn't have this problem
with the loud house x lincoln
where x has been whatever the [ __ ] it
was fanfic
i didn't have a problem with that
because at least it was slightly more in
character than
yeah i gotta pause for a second oh god i
need to stop doing this
okay i'm gonna break back the recording
like a picture reading
yes he leaves your room and
closes the door you check the time to
see it's midday
i should make myself some food has it
been confirmed
that demons actually need food i mean
i can't really say anything about it
when i'm not sorting through hundreds of
hours of podcast to figure out if it's
boo
god yeah
can't do this i i can't i can't
i can unironically look not not can
i do unironically listen to angel just
asmr
play more than this what the no no this

failure
and laster you are the best 666 news
soon as you said you transferred to a
hotel what the [ __ ] is this
okay so apparently there
was what what is going on here white
you could have at least slightly more
context instead of just doing a [ __ ]
time skip are you that lazy
time skips are probably one of the worst
things you could do
just to skip important context
so once again i'm not as we know last
time i'm not just reading the pot
well as you might notice i don't know if
that part was in the
part that i actually recorded or not
anyways
it's a rule that i'm not just straight
up when i reread the pilot's lines

in hopes of getting through multiple
chapters today
to reach the funny and
all right oh wait wait so you part
huh so you have wait no no no no i'm
just here uh
now you have what so
part one of something is also part two
of a previous something
and then there's a part two of something
that isn't
the part three of the previous previous
something what
not even i i don't even know if i want
to bother figuring this out at this
wait did i actually set when i said my
uh f9 of course of course all right we
should
be back we need our all right so we are
going to start off
at chapter two if you get time kind of
tired
into a gang war in hell
with uh many views many comments
these are the worst part normally and
do
whatever that's called votes votes yeah
yeah but why is there a vote but there's
no down but what
why can i share it on tumblr like who
the hell would want to embed this into
their web page
uh anyways as a bomb went off you angel
dust and a cyclops named cherry bomb
also as a bomb went up what what bomb is
there in the pilot
i should just have a pilot in like
another workspace
we're fighting back against a snake
named serpentis and his army of
eggs sounds ridiculous out of context
and is ridiculous in context
nice uh oh god
damn i'm gonna have to pull out the
google translate again because
because it's funny uh because that would
be very annoying
ah it's probably fine uh let's
see uh hey i'm just gonna use my normal
hey thanks for the backup angie huh huh
are you kidding this is the best action
i've seen in ages
where are you where have you been anyway
i thought you went up and died or some
jerry said oh i wait once again
directing
scene from the pilot
ish we you always gotta throw in some
some completely different writing from
the previous ones
because because because you wouldn't say
then
along the way like that really who
whatever oh i wish i've been staying in
this crappy hotel on the other side of
town
some broads will let me stay run free if
i play nice
then along the way i met ian and well
here he is i accidentally just tipped my
mic sorry for the ear rape i'm trying to
avoid ear raping as much
because that's that's a very sad form of
comedy not really
considering i did it for the past like
three episodes
all right angel said is he
lit up and bomb
inch and handed cherry and tossed it
over and the three of them cover their
ears my headphones are on so i can't
cover my ears sad
or there my ears are my ears were
covered
he's a male i thought he was a female
and he has breasts like us
he said oh what is it gonna be our you
voice now i was watching through some of
my old videos
and i found australian x and everyone
pretty funny
so we're going to go with the australian
accent lime angel just gives his idea
the first damn place
first damn place what would it be damn
first place or first damn place i don't
know i'm not now i'm making fun of
things
here we go the bomb blew up and the
three of them jumped into action
yeah no no oh all right
you know no fights no prank you know no
fights pranks
problematic language oh it's not mine
i mean these crazy [ __ ] were no fun
i've been clean for two weeks
angel said as you launched an egg up
i have a empty can of mountain dew to
launch up but i'm not
uh angel said as you launched an egg up
an angel shot it and both of you were
covered in yolk holy [ __ ]
jerry said well sure to clean just as
clean as you can get before you know
what [ __ ]
load of bolivian was like i don't think
that's i mean i don't know the script to
that either to be honest
but i don't think that's it either so
angel said as he
smashed an egg and
looked at you and smiled he sort of
blushed and smiled and looked away
once again i'm doing outrageous effects
but none of you can see them because
i would not dare put a webcam on this
all right you you supported velocity and
shine a long way but then a chain was
about to grab angel
you grabbed him and you both got slammed
to the ground with you
on top of him foreshadowing
and you both accidentally kissed you
noticed and pulled back as you were
blushing but the trains were holding you
two together it caused you laying on his
angel said you looked down and blushed
yeah y'all really a mile
you asked angel looked at you in
confusion
before pinches because he had to you too
cherry kicked him out of the way see i
can't
i somehow yeah i miss kicking a can for
a second
probably should get that up in case it
spills
all right cherry kicked him out of the
way
now that's a funny part for me to
accidentally yank my headphones out
alright alright here we go if you angel
looked at you in confusion before
pinterest could get to youtube
cherry kicks him out of the way and he
snarled your [ __ ] have no class
and wha the silence remembered is the
side with the most style
or the side that isn't dead perhaps
speaking of style is your hat like alive
oh well that's none of your goddamn
business how is it
pinchus asked it's good it's gonna hurt
my throat by the end
yeah hey will that make your hat the top
and you the bottom
both angel and terry left and you
laughed along with him imagine
laughing at your own jokes don't look at
vincia said kaneki angel said
i'm not like that pivot
pinch yourself apparently i can only do
the pinch yes voice and quotation marks
while screaming then felt your ear
twitched and looked behind you don't be
white
a gun was a main angel but you pushed
him out of the way and got grabbed by
the arms and legs
once again can push
the cannon was pushed let me go get that
again all right
well i'll just make sure i'm recording
yep well now that i've uh just about
impaled my foot
with a charger sitting on my floor which
is pretty cool
we oh god we're not even halfway through
is this just going to be the pilot with
all right you then felt your ear
twitched and looked behind you
a gun was aiming at angel but you pushed
him out of the way which i just did
and got grabbed by the arms and legs not
who i meant to get but you do nice my
little spider boy
the hell was that voice you got
confusion before
you could ask you felt your arms and
legs being pulled very hard
before pinches could kill you angel came
from behind you
okay okay and knocked him
i know that's what those 14 comments are
about
oh which caused you to fall to the
ground you you all right angel asked
somehow he's you said then he extended
his hand out to you and slowly took it
and helped you up so what do you think
you're gonna get in trouble for
you think you're gonna get in trouble
for this jerry asked
and what's one little bra gonna cause
nothing more than the entire pilot
oh let's check this out uh def
uh hmm right uh let's see
anything anything interesting here
yeah yeah that's what i figured that's
what i've seen
don't need to click on you uh is that is
it okay apparently that's
just the next part so we it's very
possible we will make it
oh yeah we're definitely gonna make it
to the funnies uh i'm debating
just skipping past some of the pilot
stuff because pilot stuff is
boring considering i've already watched
and anyone who's watching this has most
we're just gonna we're just gonna we're
just gonna speed talk after that i'll
even enjoy and love my heading somewhere
two girls named charlie turns up hell
and baggy we're watching to play with
the window as we said just leave for me
angel just you sharing them and
regularly what what
what are you what what what were you
doing angela
say i owe my gold buddy a solid isn't
that a redeeming quality
helping friends with stuff not with turf
wars ending on in the up on territorial
genocide and
he said yeah you win some you lose a few
hundred
wasn't that bad anyway angel angel says
he [ __ ] play with the window again
maggie threw a dagger at the window
once again i have a can throw this skin
is coming real
wow i gotta go grab the can believe it
or not all right we're back
uh do some epics but all right we're
uh okay we still have the headphones
we're not one we haven't
lost mike audio just yet
all right all right let's see is there
uh harlequin
oh yeah that's totally what they say
yeah yeah yeah that there's a script
although admittedly this is more funny
oh god yep all right yeah what what what
would i
expect uh also i checked the other one
that i said
i remember having some weird content it
did not have the weird content
all right all right okay well is there
all right sorry
all right uh i would like to quote from
the last episode of this
arrival angel onions fun time
which uh okay i might i might just get
uh am i making an extension that
replaces any occurrence of the word
lemon with sex
because that's funny and then and then
i'll publish it on the mozilla
extensions
store all right when the limo came to a
stop you got out and how the door held
the door opened for others
ten out of ten ow an angel whispered
wish for
rush whispered something to you when he
angel angel says he kissed your nose and
walked away you blushed
deeply off to them is he gay
that had to be the reason why he was so
attracted to me
congrats you figured it out
you then follow the others inside the
hotel looked around when he did he
watched his
angel walked outside with sad face on
her you wondered why
are we just gonna like stop time for a
minute to let the sex happen
i mean that's the only thing i can think
that they can do because
the walking outside would mean that the
phone call with uh the mom
and that would mean alastair would be
like on the way
so unless they just oh also
just noticed 69 comments nice i'm gonna
ruin the 69 comments
real quick all right you follow the
others inside the hotel looked around
sigh
yeah sorry yeah that was my brother
standing in the hallway ignore me
and anyways yeah yeah
all right i'll be right back oh [ __ ] i
guess i have to read now don't i
uh let's see when the loma oh we already
wear that first paragraph
hotel and looked around as you did you
watched as charlie with his hat walked
outside with a sad face on her
you wonder why so you went to ask greggy
hey
can i talk to you about something it's
not it's not australian anymore that's
past australian that's wacko
uh like what without charlie do you know
what's wrong
do you know what's wrong do you know
yeah you know what's wrong with her
why would i laugh at it there's no
there's what's there to laugh at
psy fine she is sad because of you and
that son
of a [ __ ] baggy said as he should and
walked
up to your face and pointed an angel
what what the
way dave you asked thank thanks to you
too
noah no the hotel roaring right now is
the laughing stock
no one's won't gonna come here now the
stock prices
okay okay what exactly is this place yes
psy it's the happy hotel home for souls
that want to be redeemed
your ears perked up and looked at him
wait what did you say redeemed there's a
you asked she thinks so but not everyone
like you and potentially angel or
potentially you
an angel okay are you kidding i'm not
that type of guy
you said you're right no i mean it look
i can't survive out here
i couldn't survive two days without
shelter food or water
are you honest 100
listen um sorry for making this place a
laughingstock i didn't maintain
well sorry it's not going to cut it
anymore so take your god's name
sympathetic emotions and leave me alone
to think
please you looked at her in fear and
felt your body
shake and fear that's how that was
program works
i really don't want to be on her bad
side so it might be best to back off
as you backed away from her you felt
something free behind you
you looked up to the angel angel
um relax well relax says yes to me
angel said i'm sorry it's just that
aggie scares me so much i don't know how
you handle it
you said i have weights you don't
understand
hey can i ask you something anything my
little schnuck comes one

pinched your nose
you blushed again
okay what do you keep calling me
schnookums you asked
blushing because your show devilishly
handsome and goddamn attractive i just
can't take my eyes off you
angel said as he approached you in a
sassy female what
you tried to remain calm but he
approached you you couldn't control
once again not even halfway through the
okay okay that's way too close
not enough schnook comments
seriously what is wrong with you oh yeah
guy
you asked angel chuckled no
hell you know how do you know
angel asked uh lucky lucky yes right
right are you a guy

angel said as he moved closer to you you
blush
so much man you just a blushing mess

angel asked look look i don't know what
i did until i attracted it to me
but whatever it is mind telling me
you asked angel thought about it and
looked around oh god i got an email

sure my headphones aren't falling off
damn you hiroku all right we're back

know i got okay i'm not going with you
why should i you asked because maybe a
dick oh
[ __ ] wrong boys maybe because he a dick
says otherwise
angel asked as he pointed at your dick
the very explicit you looked and noticed
your bulge
meaning your dick was hard yeah that's
kind of obvious because i mean people
are two people too young to understand
you got so embarrassed and tried to help
damn it when did i get excited about a
male
you thought what what are you talking
about i don't know what you're
well know what you're talking about you
lion then then what
[ __ ] voice and then why are you
trying to hide yourself angel
asked i'm not eolide
angels gave us full beans looking good
and handling okay maybe i
oh no oh god all right uh
part uh part one part two the classic
thing that i complain about
because i'm feeling hard as well you
know why
because i can't resist how sexy you are
yeah what the hell was that angel says
he walked up to
you and held your hands and lower and
his lower hands
angel i can't i've never done this
before especially with a male
you said don't worry i can teach you the
basics for now let's get ourselves up to
my room and
fully motivated he's angel says he
pulled you up with him to his room
looks like it's going to be one hell of
a hell of a
oh my might leave you off on a
cliffhanger because we're uh
oh [ __ ] bro this comment may be
offensive
me one phone all right we're back uh i
had to go do real life things don't just
answer the phone and but now we're back
so we're gonna go through some comments
for this because i want to prolong
before reading this as long as possible
we have some of the classics uh a
all right is there anything interesting
ah or ah it's all boring let's go to
part two and immediately open a new tab
when you and angel went into his room
you looked around
inside oh boy i am not ready for this
you said don't worry you'll get used to
angel said so how long have you been gay
that's not how it works
you asked i'm not sure i think it was
when i
performed in front of everybody they
were dating at me and i
couldn't resist me i am irresistible
babe
angel said right what is it about you
the interest mail
angel or what is it that made it
you asked you suddenly felt very arms
wrapped around your waist
can you feel further preferring yourself
because because let me just pop this
open a new tab here we are supposed to
be a spider demon because i think yeah i
complained about
spider d uh playing about b
you look back and realized he was fully
nude
you almost freaked out and blushed hard
but he blushed hard no you don't
yeah yeah you blush off you you flush
hard
and you flop and you flush concrete
uh but he rested his hands on your
shoulders and started rubbing
you felt calm and pleasure attention
faded
wow you're good at this you said thanks
practiced with the other people angel
and you got me i was a holy life year
what was until i first lay my eyes on
news now comes not
my headphone cord just has been loving
ripping out today
so i made it so huh so you noticed your
banner before you
fell asleep in the limo yeah star or
i'm a porn star actually i do these
things sometimes for fun sometimes for
business but for now
i'm free free to be with you
angel says you whispered into your ear
it tickled your body
shook he said all right
i'll do this if it makes you happy
please just get ready on me
you pleaded as as you wish
i can teach you if you would like me to
angel says you want to lie down in his
i'm not lying down on my bed
please do you said as you had to say to
follow them
why so hesitant i don't bite
unless i get paid that much not actually
in the script
just something that would probably make
sense uh sorry
no this don't worry i won't do this to
i'd rather be the one getting [ __ ] by
you all the time
oh i called it i know there was
something in the last
one or two chapters without uh with uh
some some top and bottom oh yeah uh
what's it what's
wiper tat yin was on the top
of the chain thing that pulled them uh
and so i called it that he would he
could possibly end up being the top
he is a top why the [ __ ] am i saying
uh all right all right
all right okay that makes me feel
somewhat better angels you said
wait first remove a few [ __ ]
right voices remove a few things for me
angel said you got confused but angel
you look down and realize what he meant
now and blushed
it's very good thing you can't see my
face currently
uh angela i i can't do this i'm so
nervous
you said as you covered yourself you
want me to help you out
i have ways to help calm people down
before they do this
angel insisted oh all right
you said how [ __ ] now i can't not get
sacked
all right i'm back oh [ __ ] i forgot x
out of this chord
uh you then lie down on angel
hold it top uh and the other and he did
the rest by rubbing on your fur which
made you
for some reason god damn it here right
it's only this one time i promise
wow i didn't know you can purr angel
said i'm not even gonna bother
says the node and the nose fighter and
give it how the [ __ ] do you know that
name
uh they compare like me uh you said
tray
what the [ __ ] okay i don't like it just
can't do it that anymore
that trail angel said he then felt calm
as you were about to take off your
clothes but you felt nervous as angel
dogs in the background apparently they
angel they am i'm not looking at me he
blushing he's in chocolate just watching
your strip gets me excited
you have no idea how long i waited
waited for this like
you met them this day you
once again very quick advancement i
believe it's called uh
i'm not quite brushed up on my urban
urban dictionary
so all right here we go after a while
getting
fully undressed angel got on top of you
and looked it okay okay
i'm wrong uh who knows switch
all right all right yes for you
you said nervously after a while getting
fully undressed
angel got on top of you and looked at
your dick i'll start this off
this way you can get the hang of the
feel and trust me it'll feel like
nothing you ever felt in your life
angel said alright i trust you
don't make me regret it you said
but the feeling was so good and you
guessed it back oh god oh no no
okay okay okay over here we're so first
third person we're seeing and that
everyone's fun
i've learned this in school before a
third person omnipotent
yeah third person we're in third person
omnipotent apparently
because we are seeing both of their
faults
thoughts side by side ish
okay pause for a second but where were
we recording yep oh we're 31 minutes in
um might pull a 35er
just so i can finish this and then we'll
leave you on a cliffhanger for angel
dust history part two
because this name still confuses me
all right here we go we're on this
paragraph i believe
it's about damn time you're finally
angel thought why am i doing this just
my god here i feel so good
okay let's film kiss in the mail you
angel then brought your dick hardened
and smirked
you're really that excited to be with me
that much huh what
you asked you looked and blushed hard
hey man am i not ready for this yeah
especially considering you have another
good half of the page left to go
oh [ __ ]
relax you'll be all right angel said
comforting you he then
why does it feel so good when it feels
looks so wrong
welcome to hell my little edie should
not come
angel says he pinched your nose he needs
to be digging juggled
you smell so good angel said you get
confused as why he said that but as soon
as you're about to talk
you closed your mouth to prevent you
from yelling and pleasure as you felt
something wet wrapped around you
you look to see angel
all right how much do i want this to be
monetized eventually
i mean i'm probably already demonetized
anyway but i don't want to go full out
slight monetization yeah we can do some
slight we got slight monetization
normal monetization and heavy
monetization
all the companies aiming for heavy
monetization i'm
aiming for slight monetization you can't
see my hand motions they make this
point far better so we might try doing
uh who am i kidding you look to see
angel sucking your dick and moaned
well he had a [ __ ] voice wow your
dick tasted so much better than i
i think i might have just found my
[ __ ] [ __ ]
angel said well i'm glad you pleased
angel
i am so pleased to do this since oh
this is happening yes you've been
waiting for this huh
you asked as you rooted your teeth while
he was sucking you
we we now that was like three voices in
one
angel what do you keep calling me
snookums it's not my name
angelson well to me it is i gotta say
you look
so handsome and charming up close
and your juicy dick tastes so good than
how i imagined it to be
and the little said flattered what else
is there
you asked this he then stood up and
slowly lowered down onto your dick and
inserted it into him
both of you grunted in pleasure and
tried to hold on your moons
jeez won't be for about doing anything
you said okay
i can't don't want to spoil the surprise
angel said he then started to move up
and down on your dick
and you tried to hold in the morning so
no one knows what's going on we already
moaned earlier so it's too late for that
how much longer do we have to go
holy [ __ ] at least it's not too long
the feeling is mutual honestly yeah you
can't sound honest in an australian
accent it's just impossible
oh he's mine anyways you said angel
chuckled him back to your face and
kissed you and you kissed back he then
continued to move and he felt an
uprising pressure on your dick
what oh god damn it stop interrupting me
emails
who cares steam i think that that pause
no well there goes the communication
three minutes left there okay
no i this will take a lot shorter than
three minutes unless it's predicting the
amount of time i'm talking around it and
which is yeah probably three minutes
angel if you'll rise in something up
you said it as you wanted yeah dick is
about to release some white
light hot liquid seeds
